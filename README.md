# AcademindExpenseTracker
##Udemy Course on React JS by Academind

###This course covers Reactjs, Hooks, Redux, React Routing, Animations, Next.js and way more!

In this case, I built an expense tracker that can be filtered by year. It covers state management, props, conditional lists, and much more.

I deployed this app to GitHub Pages. You can see this app live at the following URL:
